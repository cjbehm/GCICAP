# GCICAP
Autonomous GCI and CAP script for DCS World.

## Overview
Originally created by Snafu and then further enhanced by Stonehouse, Chameleon Silk, Rivvern.

The script provides an autonomous model of combat air patrols and ground controlled interceptors for use with DCS World by mission builders. After minimal setup the script will automatically spawn CAP and GCI flights for two sides and give them patrol and intercept tasks as well as returning them to base when threats cease to be detected.

## Requirements
Note requires MIST 4.0.57 or later. Download it here https://github.com/mrSkortch/MissionScriptingTools/releases/latest
